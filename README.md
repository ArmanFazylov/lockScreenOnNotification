# lockScreenOnNotification
Python script that locks Ubuntu 16.04 screen when desktop notification (containing certain text) pops out.

Started using pomodoro technique. Installed cool pomoDone app. However, when work was ending I kept ignoring the break.
To prevent myself from nasty habit of sitting in front of my monitor for prolonged times I decided to write script that
locks monitor when pomoDone timer stops.

Script is in python. You can modify app name and notification keyword to suit your needs.
Hope this helps to stay healthy and productive. :)

Note: To run script on system boot put it in Ubuntu's "Startup Applications" (command: "python ../path/to/script/script.py &:")
